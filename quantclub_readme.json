This repository provides efficient and easy-to-use implementations of indicators that are vital for analyzing market trends, generating signals, and backtesting strategies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📊 Supported Indicators\r\n\r\nCurrently, the library includes the following technical indicators:  \r\n- **Supertrend**: Identifies trends and generates buy/sell signals based on volatility.  \r\n- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.  \r\n- **Stochastic Oscillator**: Compares a specific closing price to a range of its prices over time.  \r\n- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: Quantifies trend strength and direction.  \r\n- **Bollinger Bands**: Identifies overbought or oversold market conditions using a simple moving average and standard deviation.  \r\n- **Heikin Ashi**: Smooths out price action for clearer trend identification.  \r\n\r\n> 🚀 **Planned Additions**:  \r\n> This library is a work in progress. We aim to continuously expand it by adding more indicators, including:  \r\n> - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (**MACD**)  \r\n> - Fibonacci Retracement Levels  \r\n> - Ichimoku Cloud  \r\n> - Pivot Points  \r\n> - Average True Range (**ATR**)  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🛠️ How to Use\r\n\r\n1. **Clone the Repository**  \r\n   Start by cloning this repository to your local system:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git clone https://github.com/your-username/technical-indicators.git\r\n   cd technical-indicators\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**  \r\n   Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Run an Indicator Script**  \r\n   Execute one of the indicator scripts to calculate values. For example:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   python indicators/rsi.py\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Integrate with Your Project**  \r\n   Import the indicator functions into your own trading strategy or application.  \r\n   Example:\r\n   ```python\r\n   from indicators.supertrend import calculate_supertrend\r\n\r\n   # Example usage:\r\n   supertrend_df = calculate_supertrend(data, period=10, multiplier=3)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Objectives\r\n\r\nThis repository aims to:  \r\n- Provide **accurate implementations** of commonly used technical indicators.  \r\n- Grow into a **comprehensive library** for building and testing trading systems.  \r\n- Help traders and developers **learn, experiment, and innovate** in financial markets.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🤝 Contributions\r\n\r\nWe welcome contributions to help grow this library!  \r\nIf you would like to contribute:\r\n1.
