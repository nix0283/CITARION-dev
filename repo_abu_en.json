intelligent-strategy which be able to explained by of a word.\n\nAbu can help users to improve the strategy automatically, take the initiative to analyze the behavior of the orders generated by the strategy to prevent the losing-money transaction.\n\nRight now, we still writting code by hand, abu is designed to be running complete-automatically in the future, including the entire work-process and strategy itself.\n\nOur expectations : abu users only need to provide some seed strategy, on the basis of these seeds, computer continue to self-learning, self-growth, to build a new strategy which can adjust its parameters  with the time series data.\n\n\n###  🏆 [WEB: https://www.abuquant.com](https://www.abuquant.com)\n\n1. 🇨🇳 [CN symbol
